# Custom Avalanche Subnet Implementation

During my blockchain development journey, I created a custom Avalanche subnet that pushes the boundaries of blockchain scalability and efficiency. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to subnet design, focusing on performance, flexibility, and advanced communication protocols.

## Project Overview

The subnet implementation addresses critical challenges in blockchain network design through innovative features:

### Dynamic Fee Structure
- Intelligent base fee adjustment based on real-time network load
- Sophisticated multiplier system for peak usage periods
- Granular fee optimization across different transaction types

### Cross-Subnet Communication
- Secure and efficient message passing between subnets
- Robust support for cross-chain asset transfers
- Comprehensive message verification and tracking mechanisms

### Validator Management System
- Stake-based validator selection and management
- Dynamic validator set updates
- Comprehensive performance monitoring infrastructure

### Registration Cost Optimization
- Adaptive cost adjustment based on network utilization
- Automated price discovery mechanisms
- Advanced protection against network spam and abuse

## Key Implementation Highlights

### Validator Integration Example
```go
config := subnet.SubnetConfig{
   MinStake:       big.NewInt(1000),
   MaxValidators:  100,
   BaseFee:        big.NewInt(1),
   DynamicFeeMult: 2,
}
mySubnet := subnet.NewSubnet(config)
err := mySubnet.AddValidator(validatorAddr, stake)
```

### Cross-Subnet Messaging
```go
warp := subnet.NewWarpMessenger(mySubnet)
messageID, err := warp.SendMessage(
   "destination-chain-123",
   payload,
   amount,
)
```
